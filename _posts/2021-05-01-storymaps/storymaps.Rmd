When great new research gets published with PMA data, we like to share it with you in a [PMA Publications](../../index.html#category:PMA_Publications) post. Sometimes we'll take a deep dive into the R code you can use to [reproduce great analysis](../2021-04-01-et-internal-migration/index.html), but today we'll take a look at a different tool that undergraduate students are using to learn about IPUMS PMA and [other IPUMS Global Health data](https://globalhealth.ipums.org/) at the University of Minnesota.

Have a recent publication using PMA data that youâ€™d like to feature in a [PMA Publications](../../index.html#category:PMA_Publications) post? Please [let us know](https://github.com/ipums/pma-data-hub/issues/new)!

This semester, students in the [Global Health Survey Analysis](https://umn.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=e977beb52a9e4169a0ba5584336cd934&view=list#content) course used an amazing tool called [StoryMaps](https://storymaps.umn.edu/) to develop interactive narratives exploring different topics related to family planning. StoryMaps have been used in both the undergraduate and graduate curriculum throughout the College of Liberal Arts and beyond - we encourage you to check out the full gallery of student projects [here](https://storymaps.umn.edu/pages/gallery)!

*Thanks to course professors [Elizabeth Boyle](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/boyle014) and [Kathryn Grace](https://www.kathryn-q-grace.com/) for sharing this great work!*
