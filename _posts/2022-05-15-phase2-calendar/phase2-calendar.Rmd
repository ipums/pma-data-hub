We're wrapping up our introduction to the new [PMA Panel Surveys](../../index.html#category:Panel_Data) this week with an update to a topic we first introduced [one year ago](../2021-05-15-paa-2021/) when [IPUMS PMA](https://pma.ipums.org/pma/) released Phase 1 data from Burkina Faso, DRC, Kenya, and Nigeria. With the release of Phase 2 data from these countries this spring, it's now possible to combine monthly [contraceptive calendar](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/group?id=fem_cal) data collected at multiple timepoints, each covering partially overlapping periods in the reproductive health history of every panel member. 

The contraceptive calendar data are particularly exciting because they offer researchers an opportunity to explore longitudinal analysis techniques that are otherwise not feasible with the first two phases of panel observations. For example, we'll demonstrate how you might use [survival analysis](https://github.com/therneau/survival) to test whether women with [unmet need](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/UNMETYN#codes_section) or [plans to adopt](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/FPPLANWHEN#codes_section) a family planning method at Phase 1 were quicker to begin using one in the months between Phase 1 and Phase 2. Additionally, because calendar data are collected once *per phase*, there are unique opportunities to study the reliability of self-reporting for the same month recalled at different times [@Anglewicz2022-mx].

<aside>
Newcomers to the **contraceptive calendar** should check out our [previous blog post](..//2021-05-15-paa-2021/), including video from a workshop from the [2021 Population Association of America](https://www.populationassociation.org/paa-2021/home) annual meeting.
</aside>

In this post, we'll share code you can use to parse and analyze calendar data collected in each phase in a data extract containing multiple samples. We'll use the [survival](https://github.com/therneau/survival) package for R to model "time-to-event" for adoption of a family planning method for women who were not using one on the day of the Phase 1 interview. Finally, we'll use [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html) to build a Kaplan-Meier curve for the cumulative incidence of adoption over each month between the Phase 1 and Phase 2 interviews. 

# Setup

Over on the contraceptive calendar [variable group page](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/group/fem_cal), you'll find two types of calendars for every sample: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/vargroup.png")
```

We refer to the main calendar as the "contraceptive calendar", and it includes the following variables: 

  * `r varlink(CALENDARBF)`
  * `r varlink(CALENDARCD)`
  * `r varlink(CALENDARKE)`
  * `r varlink(CALENDARNG)`
  
This calendar represents contraceptive use, pregnancy, pregnancy termination, and birth information for each month preceding the interview for the Female Questionnaire in a particular phase of the panel study. Women are asked to recall their status for each month in the calendar period, and their responses are recorded in a single comma delimited string with the following codes: 

  * `B` - Birth
  * `P` - Pregnant
  * `T` - Pregnancy ended
  * `0` - No family planning method used
  * `1` - Female Sterilization
  * `2` - Male Sterilization
  * `3` - Implant
  * `4` - IUD
  * `5` - Injectables
  * `7` - Pill
  * `8` - Emergency Contraception
  * `9` - Male Condom
  * `10` - Female Condom
  * `11` - Diaphragm
  * `12` - Foam / Jelly
  * `13` - Standard Days / Cycle beads
  * `14` - LAM
  * `30` - Rhythm method
  * `31` - Withdrawal
  * `39` - Other traditional methods

The second calendar is the "discontinuation calendar", and it gives the reason why a woman stopped using a family planning method for each month following an episode of continuous use. This calendar is represented by the following variables: 

  * `r varlink(CALENDARBFWHY)`
  * `r varlink(CALENDARCDWHY)`
  * `r varlink(CALENDARKEWHY)`
  * `r varlink(CALENDARNGWHY)`

Like the main contraceptive calendar, the discontinuation calendar is a single comma delimited string. It contains the following codes for months when a method was discontinued (and is blank otherwise): 

  * `1` - Infrequent sex / husband away
  * `2` - Became pregnant while using
  * `3` - Wanted to become pregnant
  * `4` - Husband / partner disapproved
  * `5` - Wanted more effective method
  * `6` - Side effects / health concerns
  * `7` - Lack of access / too far
  * `8` - Costs too much
  * `9` - Inconvenient to use
  * `10` - Up to God / fatalistic
  * `11` - Difficult to get pregnant / menopausal
  * `12` - Marital dissolution / separation
  * `96` - Other

We've created a data extract containing all of the eight calendar variables, plus these additional variables that we'll need for our analysis: 

  * `r varlink(RESULTFQ)` - Result of female questionnaire
  * `r varlink(FQINSTID)` - Unique ID for female questionnaire 
  * `r varlink(RESIDENT)` - Household residence / membership
  * `r varlink(COUNTRY)` - Country of residence
  * `r varlink(INTFQMON)` & `r varlink(INTFQYEAR)` - Date of Female Questionnaire interview 
  * `r varlink(FPCURREFFMETHRC)` - Most effective current family planning method (recoded^[The related variable `r varlink(FPCURREFFMETH)` reports the most effective method reported by each woman. In `r varlink(FPCURREFFMETHRC)`, these responses are combined with detailed information about her use of the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency contraception, or specific types of injectable methods.]) 
  * `r varlink(PREGNANT)` - Current pregnancy status
  * `r varlink(UNMETYN)` - Total unmet need
  * `r varlink(FPPLANVAL)` - When will start using FP method in the future - value
  * `r varlink(FPPLANWHEN)` - When will start using FP method in the future - unit 
  * `r varlink(KID1STBIRTHMO)` & `r varlink(KID1STBIRTHYR)` - Date of first childbirth
  * `r varlink(LASTBIRTHMO)` & `r varlink(LASTBIRTHYR)` - Date of most recent childbirth
  * `r varlink(PANELBIRTHMO)` & `r varlink(PANELBIRTHYR)` - Date of childbirth during the panel study
  * `r varlink(OTHERBIRTHMO)` & `r varlink(OTHERBIRTHYR)` - Date of any other childbirth during the calendar period 
  * `r varlink(PREGENDMO)` & `r varlink(PREGENDYR)` - Date of most recent pregnancy termination (miscarriage, abortion, or stillbirth)
  * `r varlink(PANELPREGENDMO)` & `r varlink(PANELPREGENDYR)` - Date of pregnancy termination during the panel study (miscarriage, abortion, or stillbirth)
  * `r varlink(FPBEGINUSEMO)` & `r varlink(FPBEGINUSEYR)` - Date of adoption for currently used family planning method

Our extract contains data from all available longitudinal samples.^[Burkina Faso, Kenya, DRC (Kinshasa and Kongo Central), and Nigeria (Kano and Lagos)] As in [previous posts](../2022-03-15-phase2-formats/index.html), we've selected "Female Respondents" organized in wide format: **each row** represents the Phase 1 and Phase 2 responses for **one female respondent**. Variables from the Phase 1 questionnaire are named with the suffix `_1` (e.g. `CALENDARKE_1`), while variables from the Phase 2 questionnaire are named with the suffix `_2` (e.g. `CALENDARKE_2`).

We'll load the data extract into R together with each of the packages we'll feature in this post. Then, we'll drop cases for women who did not fully complete the Female Questionnaire or were not members of the *de facto* population in both phases. 

Finally, we'll modify two variables to make this post a bit easier to read. First, we'll transform `r varlink(COUNTRY)` into a [factor](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/as_factor.html) containing a two-letter ISO country code for each sample.^[`r varlink(COUNTRYSTR)` also contains ISO codes for each country, but it contains blank values for women with responses from only one phase.] Second, we'll generate a short ID for each woman based on her location in the dataframe: **this is for display purposes only** - we recommend that users adopt `r varlink(FQINSTID)` for their own analyses. 

<aside>
Note: there are two regionally representative samples each from DRC and Nigeria. We'll combine samples from the same country here, as both use the same variables for the contraceptive calendar.

dat <- dat %>% select(-starts_with("FPSTOPUS"))

# drop LASTDOBCMC: we'll make our own below (with a consistant naming pattern)
dat <- dat %>% select(-starts_with("LASTDOB"))
```


# Century Month Codes (CMC)

As shown above, we'll be referencing several variables representing **dates** in this post. Generally, IPUMS PMA publishes every date with two variables: one representing the month (e.g. `r varlink(INTFQMON)`) and one representing the year (e.g. `r varlink(INTFQYEAR)`). Sometimes, you'll notice a third variable representing dates with a **century month code (CMC)**: each CMC represents the number of months that have passed between a given date and January 1900. CMC dates are particularly useful for calculating the time between events because they replace two variables (with different units) with one simple integer. 

Some CMC variables are available directly from IPUMS PMA (e.g. `r varlink(INTFQCMC)`), but we'll create our own CMC variables for all of the dates we'll reference in this post. CMC dates are simply calculated as follows: 

$$CMC = Month + 12*(Year – 1900)$$

Because all or part of a date may be **missing** (the month or year), and because certain dates may be **NIU (not in universe)** (e.g. "date of most recent childbirth" for women who have never given birth), we'll need to consider specific circumstances where we should use the value `NA` in a CMC variable. 

In the contraceptive calendar, we'll be measuring the time between events in *months*. Therefore, it would be insufficient to include cases where a woman only reported the *year* in which an event occurred. We'll create a function that generates `NA` values if the numeric code representing a month is `90` or higher (all valid months are coded 1 through 12), and if a year is `9000` or higher (all valid years are in the 1900s or 2000s). Otherwise, we'll use the CMC formula to calculate the appropriate CMC value for each date. 

<div>
Let's call this function `make_cmc`:

```{r}
make_cmc <- function(mo, yr){
  case_when(mo < 90 & yr < 9000 ~ mo + 12*(yr - 1900))
}
```
</div>

<aside>
With [case_when](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when.html), any "case" not explicitly covered by `mo < 90 & yr < 9000` is assigned the value `NA`. 
</aside>

You can apply `make_cmc` to any combination of variables representing the month and year for a date. We'll create one `CMC` for each date in our data extract. 

```{r}
dat <- dat %>% 
  mutate(
    INTFQCMC_1 = make_cmc(INTFQMON_1, INTFQYEAR_1),
    INTFQCMC_2 = make_cmc(INTFQMON_2, INTFQYEAR_2),
    KID1STBIRTHCMC_1 = make_cmc(KID1STBIRTHMO_1, KID1STBIRTHYR_1),
    KID1STBIRTHCMC_2 = make_cmc(KID1STBIRTHMO_2, KID1STBIRTHYR_2),
    LASTBIRTHCMC_1 = make_cmc(LASTBIRTHMO_1, LASTBIRTHYR_1),
    LASTBIRTHCMC_2 = make_cmc(LASTBIRTHMO_2, LASTBIRTHYR_2),
    OTHERBIRTHCMC_1 = make_cmc(OTHERBIRTHMO_1, OTHERBIRTHYR_1),
    OTHERBIRTHCMC_2 = make_cmc(OTHERBIRTHMO_2, OTHERBIRTHYR_2),
    PANELBIRTHCMC_1 = make_cmc(PANELBIRTHMO_1, PANELBIRTHYR_1),
    PANELBIRTHCMC_2 = make_cmc(PANELBIRTHMO_2, PANELBIRTHYR_2),
    PREGENDCMC_1 = make_cmc(PREGENDMO_1, PREGENDYR_1),
    PREGENDCMC_2 = make_cmc(PREGENDMO_2, PREGENDYR_2),
    PANELPREGENDCMC_1 = make_cmc(PANELPREGENDMO_1, PANELPREGENDYR_1),
    PANELPREGENDCMC_2 = make_cmc(PANELPREGENDMO_2, PANELPREGENDYR_2),
    FPBEGINUSECMC_1 = make_cmc(FPBEGINUSEMO_1, FPBEGINUSEYR_1),
    FPBEGINUSECMC_2 = make_cmc(FPBEGINUSEMO_2, FPBEGINUSEYR_2)
  ) 
```

Let's check our work. For example, consider how we've handled `PANELBIRTHCMC_2` - the date of a woman's childbirth that happened during the panel study. If we count the dates by `PANELBIRTHMO_2` and use [tail](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/head.html) to examine the last few rows, we see that one woman reported code `97` indicating that she did not know the precise month of birth. Meanwhile, there were 15,064 cases coded `99` indicating that they were **NIU (not in universe)** (no birth occurred during the panel study). We've coded both of these case types with the value `NA`; all other values follow the CMC formula to count the number of months between January 1900 and the month of birth. 

```{r}
dat %>% 
  count(PANELBIRTHMO_2, PANELBIRTHYR_2, PANELBIRTHCMC_2) %>% 
  tail()
```

# Merging Country Calendars  

You may be wondering: why does IPUMS PMA publish a separate calendar variable for *each country*? 

In fact, the width of each calendar variable differs by the number of months women were asked to recall in a particular sample. This, in turn, depends on the range of dates in which women were interviewed for the Female Questionnaire in a particular phase. 

## Start and Stop Dates 

You can find the precise range of dates included in each calendar on the [description tab](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/CALENDARKE#universe_section) for each country's calendar variable.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/startmo.png")
```

The first month in each country's calendar is listed below: 

| Country        | Phase 1         | Phase 2      |
| -------------- |---------------- | ------------ |
| Burkina Faso   | Jan 2018        | Jan 2018     |
| DRC            | Jan 2017        | Jan 2018     |
| Kenya          | Jan 2017        | Jan 2018     |
| Nigeria        | Jan 2017        | Jan 2018     |

Before we can merge calendars for multiple samples, we'll need to determine the correct beginning and ending points for each woman's calendar. First, we'll create `CALSTART_1` and `CALSTART_2` to record the CMC date for the first month. 

```{r}
dat <- dat %>% 
  mutate(
    CALSTART_1 = if_else(COUNTRY == "BF", 2018, 2017),
    CALSTART_2 = 2018,
    across(c(CALSTART_1, CALSTART_2), ~12*(.x - 1900) + 1)
  ) 
```

Next, we'll create `CALSTOP_1` and `CALSTOP_2` to record the CMC date we created in `INTFQCMC_1` and `INTFQCMC_2`. These dates cover a range of months in each sample.

| Country        | Phase 1             | Phase 2             |
| -------------- |-------------------- | ------------------- |
| Burkina Faso   | Dec 2019 - Mar 2020 | Dec 2020 - Apr 2021 |
| DRC            | Dec 2019 - Feb 2020 | Dec 2020 - Mar 2021 |
| Kenya          | Nov 2019 - Dec 2019 | Nov 2020 - Dec 2020 |
| Nigeria        | Dec 2019 - Jan 2020 | Dec 2020 - Feb 2021 |

```{r}
dat <- dat %>% 
  mutate(
    CALSTOP_1 = INTFQCMC_1,
    CALSTOP_2 = INTFQCMC_2
  )
```

Now, let's take a look at the calendar variables we want to merge. You'll only find responses in the calendar for the country in which a woman resides. The other calendars in her row will appear as an empty character string, the value `""`. For example, notice that the variable `CALENDARKE_1` is blank for these women from Burkina Faso:

```{r}
dat %>% 
  filter(COUNTRY == "BF") %>% 
  select(ID, COUNTRY, CALENDARBF_1, CALENDARKE_1)
```

## Pivot Country Calendars

We'll want to use [pivot_longer](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) to reformat `dat` so that *each calendar variable appears in a separate row*, including calendars collected in different phases of the panel study. Let's call our reformatted data frame `cals`. For now, it will only include `ID`, `COUNTRY`, and all variables that start with `CAL`. 

```{r}
cals <- dat %>% select(ID, COUNTRY, starts_with("CAL"))
```

We'll "pivot" `cals` in two steps. First, we'll strip the numeric suffix from each calendar variable: we'll store this information in a new column called `PHASE`. All of the calendar variables from the same phase will then be stored in a separate row (resulting in two rows per woman). 

```{r}
cals <- cals %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("CAL"),
    names_pattern = "(.*)_(.*)",
    names_to = c(".value", "PHASE")
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cals <- cals %>% 
  relocate(starts_with("CALENDARBF"), .before = CALENDARKE)
```

```{r}
cals 
```

Before we "pivot" a second time, we'll want to identify suffixes that we can again strip and use as new column names (just as we did with `_1` and `_2` when we created `PHASE`). Let's use `FPSTATUS` for the main contraceptive calendar, and `WHYSTOP` for the discontinuation calendar. When we [pivot_longer](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) again, these suffixes will appear as two new columns containing each type of calendar. 

```{r}
cals <- cals %>% 
  rename_with(
    ~paste0(.x, "FPSTATUS"),
    .cols = starts_with("CALENDAR") & !ends_with("WHY")
  ) %>% 
  rename_with(
    ~paste0(.x, "STOP"),
    .cols = starts_with("CALENDAR") & ends_with("WHY")
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("CALENDAR"),
    names_pattern = "CALENDAR(..)(.*)",
    names_to = c("COUNTRY_CAL", ".value"),
    values_to = "CALENDAR_STRING"
  )
```

Now, each woman occupies eight rows (4 country calendars per phase). We've also stripped the 2-letter country code from each calendar name to create `COUNTRY_CAL`: this indicates the country associated with each calendar. 

```{r}
cals 
```

Lastly, we can drop any row where `COUNTRY` does not match the value in `COUNTRY_CAL`:

```{r}
cals <- cals %>% 
  filter(COUNTRY_CAL == COUNTRY) %>% 
  select(-COUNTRY_CAL)

cals 
```

We're nearly ready to split each string into more usable variables for our analysis. But, before we do so: you might notice that there are still some calendars represented by empty character strings `""` (see `FPSTATUS` in rows 6 and 10 above). These are cases where calendar data are not available. 

# Data Availability

There are two reasons why a woman's calendar might be unavailable. 

First, these women might be **NIU (not in universe)**, as described on the IPUMS PMA [universe tab](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/CALENDARKE#universe_section) for each country's contraceptive calendar. Generally, NIU cases are women who reported no qualifying event during the calendar period: a blank string could indicate that she was never pregnant and never adopted or discontinued a family planning method in any month during that period. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/universe.png")
```

<aside>
The **universe tab** explains why some cases are **NIU (not in universe)**.
</aside>

Second, a blank might reflect **missing** data, like the duration of a pregnancy or an episode of continuous contraceptive use. Contraceptive calendars **do not contain missing values for individual months**, so you'll find the complete calendar missing if data from any one month was missing. 

Currently, about 1 in every 5 calendars is blank `""` for one of these two reasons. 

```{r}
cals %>% count(FPSTATUS == "") %>% mutate(prop = prop.table(n))
```

In some research applications, you might want to complete the empty calendars for women who were NIU. For example: if a woman used the contraceptive pill from the beginning of the calendar period continuously through the day of the interview, her calendar is currently blank because she did not adopt or discontinue using the pill in that time span. You might want to fill her calendar with the value `7` repeated once for every month between `CALSTART` and `CALSTOP`. 

Similarly, we can complete all calendars for women who never used a family planning method and were never pregnant during the calendar period: in this case, we'll repeat the value `0`. 

Note, however, that it is *not* possible to complete calendars for women who experienced birth or pregnancy termination during the calendar period. If these calendars are blank, we cannot determine the duration of the pregnancy or whether any family planning method was used prior to the pregnancy. We'll flag these cases with a new variable we'll call `CALMISSING`. 

We'll begin by attaching all of the `CMC` variables we created above (except `INTFQCMC`) along with the variables `r varlink(PREGNANT)` and `r varlink(FPCURREFFMETHRC)`. In order to match the format of `cals`, we'll again use [pivot_longer](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) to create separate rows for the dates collected from each `PHASE`. 

```{r}
cals <- dat %>% 
  select(
    ID, matches("CMC") & !matches("INTFQ"),
    starts_with("PREGNANT"), starts_with("FPCURREFFMETHRC"),
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    !ID,
    names_pattern = "(.*)_(.*)",
    names_to = c(".value", "PHASE")
  ) %>% 
  full_join(cals, by = c("ID", "PHASE"))

cals 
```

Now, we'll create `CALMISSING` to indicate whether women with an empty value `""` in `FPSTATUS` were *actually* pregnant or adopted a family planning method at some point during the calendar period. In other words: we'll test whether any one of our `CMC` variables shows an event that occurred after `CALSTART`, but is not recorded in `FPSTATUS`. Likewise, this check will determine whether any such women are *currently* pregnant. 

```{r}
cals <- cals %>% 
  mutate(
    .after = PHASE,
    CALMISSING = FPSTATUS == "" & WHYSTOP == "" & {
      PREGNANT == 1 | if_any(ends_with("CMC"), ~!is.na(.x) & .x >= CALSTART)
    }
  ) %>% 
  relocate(CALSTART, .after = CALMISSING)

cals 
```

You can see in this output, for example, that the woman in row 10 (`ID == 5` and `PHASE == 2`) should have a calendar starting in month `1417`. She tells us in `LASTBIRTHCMC` that she gave birth in month `1422`, 5 months after the calendar period began, but the string we would expect to find in `FPSTATUS` is blank. We have flagged this row with `CALMISSING` because we won't be able to reconstruct her `FPSTATUS` calendar without knowing exactly when she became pregnant for this birth, or whether she was using a family planning method in any month prior. 

On the other hand, women with blank `FPSTATUS` calendars who were *not* flagged with `CALMISSING` have not given birth or switched family planning methods during the calendar period. We can assume that they have held their current status between `CALSTART` and `CALSTOP`. 

Prior to this procedure, 1 in 5 rows in `cals` contained an empty `FPSTATUS` calendar. With help from `CALMISSING`, we'll now be able to reduce the proportion of empty calendars to less than 1 in 20.  

```{r}
cals %>% count(CALMISSING, FPSTATUS == "") %>% mutate(prop = prop.table(n))
```

We'll now complete the blank calendars for women who were not flagged by `CALMISSING`. First, we'll recode `FPCURREFFMETHRC` to match the values used in the calendar:

```{r}
cals <- cals %>% 
  mutate(
    FPCURREFFMETHRC = FPCURREFFMETHRC %>% 
      zap_labels() %>% 
      # NA if "No response or missing" (1 case)
      na_if(998) %>%
      # Note: 5 is used twice, and 6 is not used 
      recode(
        "999" = 0, "101" = 1, "102" = 2, "111" = 3, "112" = 4, "121" = 5,
        "123" = 5, "131" = 7, "132" = 8, "141" = 9, "142" = 10, "151" = 11, 
        "152" = 12, "160" = 13, "170" = 14, "210" = 30, "220" = 31, "240" = 39
      )
  ) 
```

Then, we'll create `CALDUR` to calculate the duration (in months) of each woman's calendar. 

```{r}
cals <- cals %>% mutate(CALDUR = CALSTOP - CALSTART + 1)
```

Finally, we'll complete each empty string in `FPSTATUS` for women not flagged by `CALMISSING` (leaving it the same otherwise). To clean-up, we'll also drop any variables that are no longer needed.

```{r}
cals <- cals %>% 
  mutate(FPSTATUS = if_else(
    # If `FPSTATUS` is blank and `CALMISSING` is FALSE...
    FPSTATUS == "" & !CALMISSING,
    # Repeat "," and the value in `FPCURREFFMETHRC` as many times as `CALDUR`:
    str_c(",", FPCURREFFMETHRC) %>% str_dup(CALDUR), 
    # Otherwise, recycle `FPSTATUS` as a character string:
    as.character(FPSTATUS)
  )) %>% 
  select(-c(
    ends_with("CMC"), CALDUR, CALSTOP, 
    CALMISSING, PREGNANT, FPCURREFFMETHRC
  ))
```


# Splitting months into columns   

We've now completed as many of the blank calendars as we can, so it's time to transform each calendar string into variables that will be usable in survival analysis. 

We'll begin with another [pivot_longer](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) function to position `FPSTATUS` and `WHYSTOP` together in a single column. Notice the temporary column `name` describes the type of calendar that appears in the temporary column `value`. 

```{r}
cals <- cals %>% pivot_longer(c("FPSTATUS", "WHYSTOP"))

cals 
```

Now, we'll use [separate](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate) to split each string into several columns. You can manually specify the maximum number of columns you'll need to hold all of the calendars in your data extract, or you can let R determine the [max](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Extremes.html) length of each string.^[Here, we're counting the number of commas in each string, so we add `+1` (e.g. `0,0,0` has two commas, but three responses).] We'll call this number `ncols`.

```{r}
# How many columns would be needed for the single longest calendar? 
ncols <- max(str_count(cals$value, ","), na.rm = TRUE) + 1
ncols 
```

In [separate](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate), we tell R to split each string `into` 48 columns: if any given calendar has fewer than 48 values, we `fill` the left-most columns with the value `NA` as needed. 

```{r}
# Create one column for every month in the longest calendar
cals <- cals %>% 
  separate(value, into = paste0("cal", ncols:1), sep = ",", fill = "left", )

cals 
```

As you can see, this produced 48 columns named `cal48` to `cal1`, where `cal1` is the earliest month in chronological time. You'll notice some blank strings for women whose calendar included empty placeholders (e.g. `,,,,,,,3,3,3...`). We'll now use [across](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html) to convert blank strings `""` to `NA` as well. 

```{r}
cals <- cals %>% 
  mutate(across(
    starts_with("cal", ignore.case = FALSE),
    ~na_if(.x, "")
  ))

cals 
```

We'll now [pivot_longer](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) again, placing each month into a single column temporarily called `value`. The label in `name` describes whether a particular `value` originated in the `FPSTATUS` or `WHYSTOP` calendar. We strip the numeric suffix from each column to create `MONTH`, which indicates the sequential month associated with each `value`. 

```{r}
cals <- cals  %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    starts_with("cal", ignore.case = FALSE), 
    names_to = "MONTH", 
    names_prefix = "cal"
  )

cals 
```

From `MONTH` and `CALSTART`, we'll derive `CALCMC` to mark the *calendar* month for each `value`. 

```{r}
cals <- cals %>%
  mutate(CALCMC = CALSTART + as.integer(MONTH) - 1)

cals
```

Finally, we'll use [pivot_wider](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider) to align the months for each available calendar, and then arrange each woman's calendar by `CALCMC`. If any month includes no value from either Phase 1 or Phase 2, we'll use [filter](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html) to remove it from our data frame (these are placeholder values for future months). 

In its final format, `cals` contains one row for every month covered by the contraceptive calendar from either Phase 1 or Phase 2. You'll notice that the two calendars contain overlapping months, as with the dates between `CALCMC` 1417 and 1442 for the first woman shown below. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
options(tibble.print_min = 40)
```

```{r}
cals <- cals %>% 
  select(ID, PHASE, CALCMC, name, value) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = c(name, PHASE), 
    values_from = value
  ) %>% 
  filter(!(is.na(FPSTATUS_1) & FPSTATUS_2 == "")) %>% 
  arrange(ID, desc(CALCMC)) 

cals
```

# Analysis  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
options(tibble.print_min = 20)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE, 
  eval = TRUE,
  layout="l-body-outset",
  fig.width = 12,
  fig.height = 8,
  R.options = list(width = 100)
)
```

We mentioned at the beginning of this post that there are many ways to work with the contraceptive calendar data once you've formatted it this way. For example, we just saw that the `FPSTATUS_1` and `FPSTATUS_2` columns are a *nearly* perfect match for the woman marked `ID == 1`: she reports that she used no method of contraception between month `1417` until month `1421`. Then, in Phase 1 she recalled that she became pregnant in month `1422`; in Phase 2, she instead recalled that she became pregnant in month `1423`. In both phases, she reports that she gave birth in month `1430`, and then returned to using no family planning method. 

We encourage researchers to explore sources of **recall bias** that may account for discrepancies between the Phase 1 and Phase 2 calendars. Generally, we assume that individuals remember events more reliably when they are in recent memory, but this may not always be true! For more on the reliability of responses in contraceptive calendars across PMA samples, we strongly recommend checking out work by Anglewicz et al. [-@Anglewicz2022-mx].

Here, we'd like to highlight just one way that the PMA panel design might help researchers understand patterns in the calendar data. When we introduced the Phase 1 contraceptive calendars [one year ago](..//2021-05-15-paa-2021/), we mentioned that Phase 2 calendars would allow researchers to compare the rate of adoption for women who were using no method at Phase 1; we also suggested that you might compare adoption rates for women with [unmet need](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/UNMETYN#codes_section) or [plans to adopt](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/FPPLANWHEN#codes_section) a method within the next year. Let's now check to see whether these factors had any effect on the monthly contraceptive use status for each month between Phase 1 and Phase 2. 

First, we'll need to identify women who were not using any family planning method at Phase 1. These are cases where [FPCURREFFMETHRC_1](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/FPCURREFFMETHRC#codes_section) is coded `999` for **NIU (not in universe)**. We'll drop any other cases from our original data frame `dat`, and we'll call this new data frame `nonusers`. 

```{r}
nonusers <- dat %>% filter(FPCURREFFMETHRC_1 == 999)
```

We'll follow steps in a [previous post](../2022-04-15-phase2-indicators/index.html) to identify women who meet the PMA criteria for "unmet need" in [UNMETYN_1](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/UNMETYN#codes_section), and also those who planned to adopt a family planning method within one year at Phase 1 as shown in [FPPLANVAL_1](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/FPPLANVAL#codes_section) and [FPPLANWHEN_1](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/FPPLANWHEN#codes_section). 

```{r}
nonusers <- nonusers %>% 
  mutate(
    UNMETYN_1 = UNMETYN_1 == 1,
    FPPLANYR_1 = case_when(
      FPPLANWHEN_1 == 1 & FPPLANVAL_1 <= 12 ~ TRUE, # Within 12 months 
      FPPLANWHEN_1 == 2 & FPPLANVAL_1 == 1 ~ TRUE, # Within 1 year
      FPPLANWHEN_1 %in% c(3, 4) ~ TRUE, # Soon / now, after current pregnancy
      TRUE ~ FALSE # Includes date unknown, no response, or no intention (FPUSPLAN)
    )
  ) 
```

In that same post, we shared code you can use to create a custom [theme](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) for graphics built with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org). We named our theme `theme_pma`; if you'd like to review the code for our graphics theme, click the button below.

```{r, code_folding = "Show code for theme_pma"}
library(showtext)

sysfonts::font_add(
  family = "cabrito", 
  regular = "../../fonts/cabritosansnormregular-webfont.ttf"
)
showtext::showtext_auto()
update_geom_defaults("text", list(family = "cabrito", size = 4))

theme_pma <- theme_minimal() %+replace% 
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "cabrito", size = 13),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 22, color = "#00263A", 
                              hjust = 0, margin = margin(b = 5)),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0, margin = margin(b = 10)),
    strip.background = element_blank(),
    strip.text.y = element_text(size = 16, angle = 0),
    panel.spacing = unit(1, "lines"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, margin = margin(r = 10)),
    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10))
  )
```

Before we begin our analysis, let's see the proportion of `nonusers` in each country who had unmet need or plans to adopt a family planning method within one year at Phase 1.

```{r, code_folding = "Show code for this plot", fig.height=6}
nonusers %>% 
  count(COUNTRY, UNMETYN_1, FPPLANYR_1) %>% 
  mutate( 
    UNMETYN_1 = if_else(UNMETYN_1, "Unmet Need\n", "No Unmet Need\n"),
    FPPLANYR_1 = if_else(FPPLANYR_1, "Plan 1 Yr\n", "No Plan 1 Yr\n")
  ) %>% 
  group_by(COUNTRY) %>% 
  mutate(prop = prop.table(n), tot = sum(n)) %>% # joint percentages
  group_by(COUNTRY, UNMETYN_1) %>% 
  mutate(propcol = sum(n)/tot) %>% # column margins 
  group_by(COUNTRY, FPPLANYR_1) %>% 
  mutate(proprow = sum(n)/tot) %>% # row margins 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(
    propcol = paste(UNMETYN_1, scales::percent(propcol, .1)),
    proprow = paste(FPPLANYR_1, scales::percent(proprow, .1)),
    proplbl =  scales::percent(prop, .1)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = propcol, y = proprow)) + 
  geom_tile(fill = "#98579BB0", aes(alpha = prop)) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(COUNTRY), scales = "free") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = proplbl)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Non-users: Unmet Need and Intentions to Adopt a Method within 1 Year",
    subtitle = "Percentage among sampled women not currently using any method at Phase 1",
    x = NULL, y = NULL
  ) + 
  theme_pma %+replace% 
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), legend.position = "none")
```

As you can see, a majority of Phase 1 `nonusers` in each country had both no unmet need and no plans to adopt a method within the next year. We might expect these women to be *least likely* to adopt a method within the subsequent months covered by the Phase 2 contraceptive calendar. Conversely, we might expect that women who planned to adopt a method within the year would be *most likely* to adopt a method during the calendar period, but this might be mitigated by factors related to unmet need. 

Let's now attach the contraceptive calendar data from Phase 2 to `nonusers`. We'll exclude months before `INTFQCMC_1` and women we identified with `CALMISSING` (where all values in `FPSTATUS_2` are now `NA`). Finally, we'll exclude women for whom either `UNMETYN_1` or `FPPLANYR_1` is missing, NIU, or otherwise coded `NA`.

```{r}
nonusers <- nonusers %>% 
  select(ID, COUNTRY, INTFQCMC_1, UNMETYN_1, FPPLANYR_1) %>% 
  full_join(cals, ., by = "ID") %>% 
  filter(
    CALCMC >= INTFQCMC_1, 
    !if_any(c(FPSTATUS_2, UNMETYN_1, FPPLANYR_1), is.na)
  )
```

The next several steps will help us remove every month for each woman *except* for the last consecutive month in which she was not using a family planning method after the Phase 1 interview. For those who were still not using a method by the date of the Phase 2 interview, we might say say she "survived" the full observation period. We'll use the [survival](https://github.com/therneau/survival) package to model the likelihood that a woman would have progressed through each month of the calendar without adopting a family planning method. 

First, we'll classify every month in each woman's calendar with a new variable `USE` indicating whether she used any family planning method that month. We'll then create `MO` to count the number of months that have passed between each month and the earliest month in `CALCMC`.

```{r}
nonusers <- nonusers %>% 
  transmute(
    ID, COUNTRY, CALCMC, 
    FPSTATUS_2, UNMETYN_1, FPPLANYR_1,
    MO = CALCMC - INTFQCMC_1,
    USE = !FPSTATUS_2 %in% c("0", "B", "P", "T")
  ) 

nonusers 
```

Next, we'll create `USEMO` to copy the month recorded in `MO` for each month of `USE` (otherwise, [case_when](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when) assigns the value `NA`). If there are any months of `USE` for an individual woman, we'll identify the first such month with `ADOPT`; if there are no cases of `USE`, `ADOPT` will record the last month in `MO`. Finally we'll use `RC` to indicate whether `ADOPT` is "right censored" - these are cases where `ADOPT` is the last month in `MO`. 

```{r}
nonusers <- nonusers %>% 
  group_by(ID) %>% 
  mutate(
    USEMO = case_when(USE ~ MO),
    ADOPT = ifelse(any(USE), min(USEMO, na.rm = T), max(MO)),
    RC = case_when(ADOPT == MO ~ !USE)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() 

nonusers 
```

Notice, for example, that the first month of `USE` for `ID == 1` occurs in month 6. Hence, `ADOPT == 6` and, because she adopted a method before the end of the calendar, `RC == FALSE`. 

Finally, we'll now drop every row except for those matching `ADOPT`. This leaves one row for each woman in `nonusers`. 

```{r}
nonusers <- nonusers %>% filter(ADOPT == MO)

nonusers 
```

We'll now fit three survival models predicting the duration of continuous non-use for the women in `nonusers`: one model for `UNMETYN_1`, one for `FPPLANYR_1`, and one for their interaction effect, which we'll call `INTERACT_1`. For each model, [survfit](https://rdrr.io/cran/survival/man/survfit.html) reports the likelihood that a baseline non-user would have adopted any family planning method for each month in the calendar period. We'll run each model separately for each country, and we'll use [broom::tidy](https://generics.r-lib.org/reference/tidy.html) to create a tidy summary table for each model.

```{r}
adopt_models <- nonusers %>% 
  # Create a variable capturing the interaction between intentions and unmet need
  mutate(INTERACT_1 = case_when(
    UNMETYN_1 & FPPLANYR_1 ~ "Unmet Need, Plan 1 Yr",
    UNMETYN_1 & !FPPLANYR_1 ~ "Unmet Need, No Plan 1 Yr",
    !UNMETYN_1 & FPPLANYR_1 ~ "No Unmet Need, Plan 1 Yr",
    !UNMETYN_1 & !FPPLANYR_1 ~ "No Unmet Need, No Plan 1 Yr"
  )) %>% 
  # Separate survival models for each country 
  group_by(COUNTRY) %>% 
  summarise(
    unmet = survfit(Surv(MO, !RC) ~ UNMETYN_1, data = cur_group()) %>% list, 
    plan = survfit(Surv(MO, !RC) ~ FPPLANYR_1, data = cur_group()) %>% list, 
    interact = survfit(Surv(MO, !RC) ~ INTERACT_1, data = cur_group()) %>% list
  ) %>% 
  # Tidy the output and relabel `COUNTRY` for the figure
  mutate(
    across(where(is.list), ~map(.x, broom::tidy)),
    COUNTRY = COUNTRY %>% recode(
      "BF" = "Burkina Faso",
      "CD" = "DRC",
      "KE" = "Kenya",
      "NG" = "Nigeria"
    )
  )
```

Let's start with the model featuring `UNMETYN_1`. If you [unnest](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/nest.html) the `unmet` model output, you'll see a separate row for each month reported for women with "No Unmet Need" and "Unmet Need". 

```{r}
m_unmet <- adopt_models %>% 
  unnest(unmet) %>% 
  mutate(strata = if_else(
    str_detect(strata, "TRUE"), "Unmet Need", "No Unmet Need"
  )) %>% 
  relocate(strata, .after = COUNTRY)

m_unmet
```

The column `n.risk` shows the total number of non-users remaining after the number of months passed in `time`. The column `estimate` shows the estimated probability that a randomly selected woman would remain in `n.risk` by that month (`conf.high` and `conf.low` report a 95% confidence interval by default). 
For example, row 1 shows that there were 2245 women in the Phase 1 Burkina Faso sample who were not using family planning did not meet PMA criteria for "unmet need". Among these, `n.event` shows that 157 adopted a family planning method less than one month after the interview: this leaves 93.0% of the group remaining before one month had passed. 

Below that, row 16 shows that there were 632 women in the Phase 1 Burkina Faso sample who were not using family planning, but *did* meet PMA criteria for "unmet need". Among these, `n.event` shows that 86 adopted a family planning method less than one month after the interview: this leaves 86.4% of the group remaining before one month had passed. 

We'll produce a "time-to-event" plot by inverting the probabilities reported in `event` and its accompanying confidence interval. This plot uses [geom_step](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_path.html) to draw a step-wise function, and [geom_rect](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_tile.html) to create a shaded confidence interval for each step. 

```{r}
m_unmet %>% 
  group_by(COUNTRY, strata) %>% 
  mutate(
    across(where(is.double) & !time, ~1-.x),
    xmax = if_else(time == max(time), time, time + 1), # horizontal ci shading
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = estimate, fill = strata)) + 
  geom_step() + 
  geom_rect(
    aes(xmin = time, xmax = xmax, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high),
    alpha = 0.5, 
    color = 0
  ) + 
  facet_wrap(~COUNTRY) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Unmet Need" = "#F2300E", 
    "No Unmet Need" = "#352749"
  )) + 
  labs(
    title = "Predicted Time to FP Adoption by Phase 1 Unmet Need Status",
    x = "Consecutive Months after Phase 1 FQ Interview", y = NULL, fill = NULL
  ) +  
  theme_pma 
```

In general, we see evidence that non-users with unmet need at Phase 1 were significantly quicker to adopt a method compared to women with no unmet need in each country. 

Let's now consider how the adoption rate might be influenced to by `FPPLANYR_1`. 

```{r}
adopt_models %>% 
  unnest(plan) %>% 
  mutate(strata = if_else(
    str_detect(strata, "TRUE"), "Plan 1 Yr", "No Plan 1 Yr"
  )) %>% 
  group_by(COUNTRY, strata) %>% 
  mutate(
    across(where(is.double) & !time, ~1-.x),
    xmax = if_else(time == max(time), time, time + 1), 
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = estimate, fill = strata)) + 
  geom_step() + 
  geom_rect(
    aes(xmin = time, xmax = xmax, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high),
    alpha = 0.5, 
    color = 0
  ) + 
  facet_wrap(~COUNTRY) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Plan 1 Yr" = "#EBCC2A", 
    "No Plan 1 Yr" = "#899DA4" 
  )) +  
  labs(
    title = "Predicted Time to FP Adoption by Intentions Within 1 Year of Phase 1",
    x = "Consecutive Months after Phase 1 FQ Interview", y = NULL, fill = NULL
  ) + 
  theme_pma 
```

Here, we see that women who planned to adopt a method within 1 year following the Phase 1 interview were significantly quicker to begin using one compared to women who had no such plans (except within the first few months for women in Nigeria, where this difference was not statistically significant). Finally, let's consider the interaction reported in `INTERACT_1`. 

```{r, preview = TRUE}
adopt_models %>% 
  unnest(interact) %>% 
  group_by(COUNTRY, strata) %>%
  mutate(
    across(where(is.double) & !time, ~1-.x),
    xmax = if_else(time == max(time), time, time + 1), 
    strata = str_remove(strata, ".*=")
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = estimate, fill = strata)) + 
  geom_step() + 
  geom_rect(
    aes(xmin = time, xmax = xmax, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high),
    alpha = 0.5, 
    color = 0
  ) + 
  facet_wrap(~COUNTRY) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Unmet Need, Plan 1 Yr" = "#98579B",
    "Unmet Need, No Plan 1 Yr" = "#00263A", 
    "No Unmet Need, Plan 1 Yr" = "#CCBA72",
    "No Unmet Need, No Plan 1 Yr" = "#81A88D"
  ))  +  
  labs(
    title = "Predicted Time to FP Adoption by Phase 1 Intentions and Unmet Need",
    x = "Consecutive Months after Phase 1 FQ Interview", y = NULL, fill = NULL
  ) + 
  theme_pma 
```

The interaction between `UNMETYN_1` and `FPPLANYR_1` seems to confirm at least one of our hypotheses: non-users who had no unmet need and no plans to adopt a method within the year were significantly slower to do so (again, except for the first few months shown in Nigeria). Women without plans to adopt a method were also somewhat slower to adopt a method if they experienced unmet need, but there are considerable differences in the strength of this finding across countries and over the length of the calendar period. Overall, women who planned to adopt a method were significantly quicker to do so, but the mitigating effects of unmet need are generally unclear. 

We hope this preliminary analysis serves as an entry point for your own exploration of the contraceptive calendar data included in each PMA panel survey. Stay tuned here for updates in the coming months, when we'll return to the calendar to see how rainfall, temperature, and other climate shocks impact monthly family planning behavior.
