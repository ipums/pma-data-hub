  abstract = {During the past half century, fertility declines have been pervasive in Asia and Latin America. Between the early 1950s and the early 2000s, the total fertility rate  (TFR)-the average number of live births a woman would have during her lifetime,  assuming constant fertility rates-dropped from 5.7 to 2.4 births per woman in Asia  and from 5.9 to 2.3 births per woman in Latin America.1 Only a handful of countries  in these regions still have fertility rates higher than four births per woman. In  Sub-Saharan Africa, however, fertility remains high in the large majority of  countries. Although some declines have occurred, the average total fertility rate in  2005-2010 exceeded 5.1 births per woman-more than double the levels observed in Asia  and Latin America.},

  abstract = {The individual impacts of several components of family planning service quality on contraceptive use have been studied, but the influence of a composite measure  synthesizing these components has not been often investigated. We (1) develop a  composite score for family planning service quality based on health facility data  from Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda and (2) examine the influence of  structural quality on contraceptive practice in these four countries. We used  nationally representative cross-sectional survey data of health facilities and women  of reproductive age. First, we constructed quality scores for facilities using  principal component analysis to integrate 18 variables. Second, we linked women to  their closest facility using geo-coordinates. Third, we estimated multivariable  logistic regression models to calculate women's odds ratios for modern contraceptive  use adjusting for facilities' quality and other factors. In Burkina Faso, Ethiopia  and Uganda, the odds of using a modern method of contraception was greater if the  nearest facility provided high- or medium-quality services compared with low quality  in the univariable model. After controlling for possible confounders, the adjusted  odds ratios were significant for high quality (aOR: 3.12, P value: 0.005) and medium  quality (aOR: 2.57, P value: 0.009) in Ethiopia and in the hypothesized direction  but not statistically significant in Uganda or Burkina Faso, and in the opposite  direction in Kenya. A process quality measure-having been visited by a community  health worker-was statistically significantly associated with modern contraceptive  use in three of the four countries (Burkina Faso aOR: 2.18, P value: 0.000; Ethiopia  aOR: 1.78, P value: 0.000; Uganda aOR: 1.96, P value: 0.012). These results suggest  that service quality in public facilities may be less relevant to contraceptive use  in environments where the universe and reach of providers changes actively. Programs  promoting contraception therefore need to consider quality within facility types and  their service environments.},

  abstract = {Interpretation of regression coefficients is sensitive to the scale of the inputs. One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean {$\pm$}1 standard deviation. The resulting coefficients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option\textemdash an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data file\textemdash so that the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.
