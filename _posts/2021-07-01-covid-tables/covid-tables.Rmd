Earlier this spring, IPUMS PMA released a harmonized version of the [PMA COVID-19 survey](https://www.pmadata.org/technical-areas/covid-19), which comes from a telephone interview with reproductive aged women in four countries who are all participants in an ongoing panel study related to family planning and reproductive health. **We're excited to feature this urgent resource all summer long here on the Data Analysis Hub**; you'll find find future posts related to PMA COVID-19 data and our last post - [an introduction to the available data](../2021-06-15-covid-discovery) - if you follow along [here](../../index.html#category:COVID-19).

As always, one of our main goals on this blog is to introduce tools that make it easy for anyone to explore new data and develop new ideas for research projects. Today, we'll be diving into a topic that has probably frustrated *everyone* who has ever presented or published statistical findings at one time or another: **making publication-ready tables**. 

If you talk to students or colleagues who use R, you might be surprised to learn that many of us don't actually use statistical software to make the tables you see when you read an academic article. In reality, plenty of us just use R to make a model, and then we copy and paste the output into a table we make by hand with Microsoft Word! This can save lots of time, and it's a perfectly reasonable solution if you know that you can make exactly what you want with the tools that Word provides. 

You might consider making tables with R if you've ever found yourself:

  * manually inserting information to several rows or columns that could be calculated by R (like significance symbols \*, \*\*, and \*\*\*)
  * endlessly tweaking row height, column width, or fonts 
  * correcting copy / paste errors or typos made while transferring information between R and Word
  * revisiting work you've already done to format a table for one publication, only to change it all for a different publication, a presentation, or a new file format (PDF, HTML, etc)

In this post, we'll show you how to get up and running with flexible, easy-to-make tables using [gtsummary](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/index.html), an R package that builds on the same [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) conventions we've featured elsewhere on this blog. There are *a lot* of different packages available to help make tables with R, but - as we'll see - we love `gtsummary` because we think it allows users to maximize choice of style and output formats, all while minimizing the amount of code necessary to implement those choices. 

<aside>
If `gtsummary` doesn't fit your needs, we also recommend [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/) (which does much of the heavy-lifting for `gtsummary`), [kableExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html), [flextable](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/), and [huxtable](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/) for different contexts.

# Setup

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
``` 

In our last post, we explained that you'll find all of the PMA COVID-19 survey data if you select the new [COVID-19 Unit of Analysis](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/extract_requests/clear?return_url=%2Fpma-action%2Fvariables%2Fgroup) in the IPUMS PMA data extract system. 

In this post, we'll work with a data extract containing the following variables. You'll be able to follow along with our coding examples if you create and download an extract containing **all four samples** (Female Respondents only) and these variables:

  * [AGE](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/AGE)
  * [MARSTAT](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/MARSTAT)
  * [EDUCATTGEN](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/EDUCATTGEN) 
  * [URBAN](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/URBAN) 
  * [HLTHCAREDIFFFEAR](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/HLTHCAREDIFFFEAR)
  
You'll also need to install these R packages if you don't haven't done so before (current versions are recommended):

  * [ipumsr](http://tech.popdata.org/ipumsr/index.html) (0.4.5)
  * [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) (1.3.1)
  * [survey](http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/) (4.0)
  * [srvyr](http://gdfe.co/srvyr/index.html) (1.0.1)
  * [gtsummary](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/index.html) (1.4.1)

When you've finished downloading your data extract and installing all of these packages, load the packages and use `read_ipums_micro()` to load the data extract into R (make sure to change the file paths to match your own extract):

```{r, results='hide'}
library(ipumsr)
library(tidyverse)
library(survey)
library(srvyr)
library(gtsummary)

covid <- read_ipums_micro(
  ddi = "data/pma_00032.xml",
  dat = "data/pma_00032.dat.gz"
)
``` 

```{r, echo = F, results='hide'}
library(crayon)
covid <- covid %>% 
  select(
    SAMPLE, COUNTRY, YEAR, ROUND, EAID, CONSENTFQ, CVQWEIGHT, 
    AGE, MARSTAT, EDUCATTGEN, URBAN, HLTHCAREDIFFFEAR
  )
```

As a reminder: women who were interviewed for the PMA COVID-19 survey are participants in a ongoing panel study focused on core PMA topics in reproductive health. The baseline survey for this panel study was conducted just a few months prior to the COVID-19 survey (between November 2019 and February 2020), but data from the baseline survey are *not included* in the COVID-19 dataset you'll download here. *We will show how to locate and merge data from the baseline survey in an upcoming post in this series.* The COVID-19 survey data are structured like all of the other cross-sectional survey datasets available from IPUMS PMA: each woman's responses are stored in a single row.

```{r}
covid
```

<aside>
Every COVID-19 data extract will contain 7 **preselected** variables in addition to those you select, yourself.

# Descriptive Statistics Table

The great thing about `gtsummary` is that you can make a high quality table with just one line of code, but you can also customize any element of your table and easily apply custom styling (you can choose between several [journal-specific themes](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/dev/articles/themes.html) or create your own). And, unlike many of other table-making packages for R, `gtsummary` supports printing directly to HTML, PDF, Word, and Rich Text Format. 

Because `gtsummary` is designed with `tidyverse` users in-mind, you can pipe functions like `dplyr::select` directly into the function [tbl_summary](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/dev/articles/tbl_summary.html), which will then identify the object class for each variable and calculate default summary statistics accordingly. To demonstrate, we'll `select` a few demographic variables, then break them down by `COUNTRY` in a basic call to  `tbl_summary()`:

```{r}
covid %>% 
  select(AGE, MARSTAT, EDUCATTGEN, URBAN, COUNTRY) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = COUNTRY)
```

<aside>
This table is not quite done yet, but notice that all of the fonts and other CSS style elements you see throughout this blog have been automatically applied to this table. Imagine how hard that would be if we made our table with Word or Excel!
</aside>

```{r, message=T, echo=F}
message(
  cyan("ℹ "), "Column(s) ", green("AGE"), ", ", green("MARSTAT"), ", ", 
  green("EDUCATTGEN"), ", ", green("URBAN"), ", ", "and ", green("COUNTRY "),
  "are class \n", blue("\'haven_labelled\'"), 
  ". This is an intermediate datastructure not meant ",
  "for analysis. \nConvert columns with `haven::as_factor()`,",
  "`labelled::to_factor()`, \n`labelled::unlabelled()`, and `unclass()`. ",
  blue("\'haven_labelled\' "), "value labels are \nignored when columns are ",
  "not converted. Failure to convert may have unintended \nconsequences or ",
  "result in error.\n\n",
  "• https://haven.tidyverse.org/articles/semantics.html\n",
  "• https://larmarange.github.io/labelled/articles/intro_labelled.html#unlabelled"
)
```

## Display value labels 

This is a very helpful starting point, but it's certainly not a finished product yet. The biggest issue is related to the alert message shown above: as we've discussed [in previous posts](../2021-01-28-across-sdp/#recoding-variables-with-ipumsr), the categorical variables you'll find in IPUMS data extracts are usually imported as `haven_labelled` objects, rather than the more common `factor` class of objects. In practice, this means that every response option from the questionnaire has both a **value** and a **label**:

```{r}
covid %>% count(MARSTAT)
```

<aside>
You can access value labels with the `ipumsr` function [ipums_val_labels](http://tech.popdata.org/ipumsr/reference/ipums_var_info.html). </aside>

The variable `MARSTAT` is a `haven_labelled` object where the **value** of each response is an integer (10, 21, 22, 31, 32, or 98), and the **label** describing each value is shown in square brackets to the right. 

When `gtsummary` warns you that 

  `This is an intermediate datastructure not meant for analysis`

...it's referring to the fact that labels are only an [attribute](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/r-in-a/9781449358204/ch07s05.html) of the variable. Attributes are metadata meant to assist the analyst running R in real-time, but they aren't typically used by R in graphics or computational analysis. 

In our table, `gtsummary` displays the numeric value for each response, rather than the much more readable labels. The easiest way to change this behavior is to coerce all of our categorical variables to the `factor` object class.

We recommend dividing this process into three steps:

  1. Identify any labels in your dataset that represent non-response codes, like `No response or missing` shown for `MARSTAT`. We'll want to exclude these from our table, so we'll convert them to the generic missing value `NA` with `ipumsr::lbl_na_if()`.
  2. Identify any labelled variables that *are not* categorical. For example, the variable `AGE` in our dataset is labelled because the values 90 through 99 can represent either a respondent's age in years (if not labelled) or a non-response code (if labelled). After converting non-response codes to `NA` in step 1, we'll want to change the class of variables like `AGE` with `ipumsr::zap_labels()`.
  3. Coerce all remaining labelled variables as factors with `ipumsr::as_factor()`, and remove any unused response options with `fct_drop()`. 

```{r}
covid <- covid %>% 
  mutate(
    across(everything(), ~lbl_na_if(
      .x,
      ~.lbl %in% c(
        "Logical edit - missing",
        "Not interviewed (female questionnaire)",
        "Not interviewed (household questionnaire)",
        "Don't know",
        "No response or missing",
        "NIU (not in universe)"
      )
    )),
    across(AGE, zap_labels),
    across(where(is.labelled), ~as_factor(.x) %>% fct_drop)
  )
```

<aside>
**Common mistake:** make sure to use the function `as_factor()` from `ipumsr`, and *not* the base R function `as.factor()`. The difference is that the former will use labels for each factor level, while the latter will use the original numeric values. 
</aside>

Coercing categorical variables as factors will greatly improve the readability of our table. Because we've introduced `NA` values, we'll add the argument `missing = "no"` to exclude them from our table:

```{r}
covid %>% 
  select(AGE, MARSTAT, EDUCATTGEN, URBAN, COUNTRY) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = COUNTRY, missing = "no")
```

## Customize variable labels 

You may have noticed that `gtsummary` ignored the *value labels* for each of our `haven_labelled` variables before we converted them into `factor` variables, but it *did* find and use *variable labels*. For example, you see the variable label `Age in female respondent questionnaire` instead of the variable name `AGE`. 

<aside>
You can access variable labels with the `ipumsr` function [ipums_var_label](http://tech.popdata.org/ipumsr/reference/ipums_var_info.html). </aside>

While this is sometimes helpful behavior, we feel that the word "Age" would have been fine on its own. Likewise, we'd like to clean up the labels for `MARSTAT`, `EDUCATTGEN`, and `URBAN` to make them as concise as possible. 

You can override the `ipumsr` value labels in your table without changing the underlying data. Just add them as a list of formulas via the `label` argument: the variable name goes on the left of `~`, and a character string containing the desired label goes on the right.  

There are a few supporting functions that allow you to stylize these labels. We'll use `italicize_labels()` to print our new labels in italics. 

```{r}
covid %>% 
  select(AGE, MARSTAT, EDUCATTGEN, URBAN, COUNTRY) %>% 
  tbl_summary(
    by = COUNTRY,
    missing = "no",
    label = list(
      AGE ~ "Age",
      MARSTAT ~ "Marital status",
      EDUCATTGEN ~ "Education",
      URBAN ~ "Urban vs Rural"
    )
  ) %>% 
  italicize_labels() 
```

## Change default statistics 

What about the statistics that `tbl_summary()` calculates? By default, `tbl_summary()` reports the median (and IQR) for integer variables like `AGE`, and it reports the frequency (and percentage) of each level for all of the `factor` variables we've created. 

You can change the statistics calculated for one or more variables by name, or you can change them for all variables of a similar type (e.g. `all_categorical`).  You'll need to choose or define a custom function, then provide it to the `stat` argument as a character string between curly brackets like this:

`"{mean}"`

Here, we'll demonstrate how to calculate the mean (and standard deviation) for `AGE`, and the percentage for all responses to all factors / categorical variables.

You may also decide to feature *information about which statistics were calculated* more prominently alongside the variable labels, rather than in the footer. Simply pipe your table to the function `add_stat_label()` as shown below: 
 
```{r}
covid %>% 
  select(AGE, MARSTAT, EDUCATTGEN, URBAN, COUNTRY) %>% 
  tbl_summary(
    by = COUNTRY,
    missing = "no",
    label = list(
      AGE ~ "Age",
      MARSTAT ~ "Marital status",
      EDUCATTGEN ~ "Education",
      URBAN ~ "Urban vs Rural"
    ),
    stat = list(
      AGE ~ "{mean} ({sd})",
      all_categorical() ~"{p}"
    )
  )%>% 
  italicize_labels() %>% 
  add_stat_label()
```

<aside>
More information about functions for table statistics can be found [here](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tbl_summary.html#statistic-argument).
</aside>

## Customize headers & footnotes 

Table headers and footnotes can be customized with the functions `modify_header()` and `modify_footnote()`. We'll remove the frequencies from our header, use the abbreviated label `DR Congo`, and remove the label `Characteristic` from the first column. Lastly, we'll add a title to our table with `modify_spanning_header()`.

```{r}
covid %>% 
  select(AGE, MARSTAT, EDUCATTGEN, URBAN, COUNTRY) %>% 
  tbl_summary(
    by = COUNTRY,
    missing = "no",
    stat = list(
      AGE ~ "{mean} ({sd})",
      all_categorical() ~"{p}"
    ),
    label = list(
      AGE ~ "Age",
      MARSTAT ~ "Marital status",
      EDUCATTGEN ~ "Education",
      URBAN ~ "Urban vs Rural"
    )
  ) %>% 
  add_stat_label() %>% 
  italicize_labels() %>% 
  modify_header(update = list(
      label ~ " ",
      stat_1 ~ "**Burkina Faso**",
      stat_2 ~ "**DR Congo <br> (Kinshasa)**",
      stat_3 ~ "**Kenya**",
      stat_4 ~ "**Nigeria <br> (Lagos & Kano)**"
  )) %>% 
  modify_spanning_header(
    everything() ~ "## Sample Demographics"
  ) 
```

<aside>
Text provided to `modify_header()`, `modify_footnote()`, and `modify_spanning_header()` can be stylized with either markdown syntax (shown) or HTML. 

Headers can span individuals columns (as shown in `modify_header()`), groups of columns, or `everything()` (as shown in `modify_spanning_header()`). 

**Tip:** if you simply want to move the sample size from the header into its own row (rather than delete it, as we've done here), you could create a new `factor` variable `N` where every person gets the value `1` in the step after our `select()` function.
</aside>

# Survey Weights 

We mentioned [in our last post](../2021-06-15-covid-discovery/#sample-design) that the PMA COVID-19 survey comes with a new weighting variable, [CVQWEIGHT](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/CVQWEIGHT#codes_section), which is analogous to the variable [FQWEIGHT](https://pma.ipums.org/pma-action/variables/FQWEIGHT) found in other Household and Female samples. `CVQWEIGHT` can be used to estimate all of the statistics shown in our table for the broader population represented by each sample (note that two of the samples are not nationally representative):

<aside>
You'll find more detail about the construction of PMA COVID-19 survey weights [here](https://pma.ipums.org/pma/resources/documentation/COVID_Survey_Weight_Construction_Memo.pdf).
</aside>

  * Burkina Faso: nationally representative
  * Kenya: nationally representative
  * DRC: Kinshasa only  
  * Nigeria: Lagos and Kano only

The [srvyr](http://gdfe.co/srvyr/index.html) package includes several functions that make it easy to incorporate survey weights into a tidy workflow. Simply provide information about the survey design to `srvyr::as_survey_design()`, and then pipe this information to a survey analysis function.

For example, a tidy workflow calculating the mean `AGE` of women in each of the four **samples** might look like this:

```{r}
covid %>% 
  group_by(COUNTRY) %>% 
  summarise(mean(AGE))
```

You can use `CVQWEIGHT` to estimate the mean `AGE` of reproductive age women in each of the four target **populations** like this: 

```{r}
covid %>% 
  as_survey_design(weight = CVQWEIGHT) %>%
  group_by(COUNTRY) %>% 
  summarise(survey_mean(AGE))
```

<aside>
Notice that all four samples skew a bit older compared to their target populations.
</aside>

Happily, `gtsummary` can read survey information from the function `as_survey_design()`. This saves us the trouble of calculating weighted statistics for each of the variables in our table; instead, we can create weighted statistics for our table with just one line of code if we swap `tbl_summary` for its companion function, `tbl_svysummary()`:

```{r}
covid %>% 
  as_survey_design(weight = CVQWEIGHT) %>% # CVQWEIGHT goes here
  select(AGE, MARSTAT, EDUCATTGEN, URBAN, COUNTRY) %>% 
  tbl_svysummary( # use tbl_svysummary() in place of tbl_summary()
    by = COUNTRY,
    missing = "no",
    stat = list(
      AGE ~ "{mean} ({sd})",
      all_categorical() ~"{p}"
    ),
    label = list(
      AGE ~ "Age",
      MARSTAT ~ "Marital status",
      EDUCATTGEN ~ "Education",
      URBAN ~ "Urban vs Rural"
    )
  ) %>% 
  italicize_labels() %>% 
  add_stat_label() %>% 
  modify_header(update = list(
      label ~ " ",
      stat_1 ~ "**Burkina Faso**",
      stat_2 ~ "**DR Congo <br> (Kinshasa)**",
      stat_3 ~ "**Kenya**",
      stat_4 ~ "**Nigeria <br> (Lagos & Kano)**"
  )) %>% 
  modify_spanning_header(
    everything() ~ "## Weighted Population Estimates"
  )
```

We've now made a weighted descriptive statistics table, and we've only changed two lines of code. As we'll see, creating a summary table from a model that uses sample design information can be just as easy.

# Model Summary Table

The `gtsummary` package also contains a function designed to summarise and format output from regression models. For example, let's build a simple logistic regression model for `HLTHCAREDIFFFEAR`, which indicates **whether a woman experienced difficulty accessing healthcare because she was afraid of becoming infected with COVID-19**. We'll try modeling this outcome using the demographic variables that are available for all four samples: `AGE`, `MARSTAT`, and `EDUCATTGEN` (`URBAN` was not available for the DRC sample).

First, we'll recode `HLTHCAREDIFFFEAR` into a binary indicator that's suitable for use in a logistic regression model. We can collapse responses "No" and "None of the above", since the latter indicates that the woman experienced no difficulties accessing healthcare at all. 

```{r}
covid %>% count(HLTHCAREDIFFFEAR)

covid <- covid %>% 
  mutate(HLTHCAREDIFFFEAR = fct_collapse(HLTHCAREDIFFFEAR, No = c(
    "No", 
    "None of the above"
  ))) 

covid %>% count(HLTHCAREDIFFFEAR)
```

## Results from one model

Because IPUMS PMA samples are collected with geographic clusters - represented by `EAID` - we generally recommend specifying both a sample weight *and* a cluster identification with `as_survey_design()`. We'll need to use a function that can build a general linear model using that survey design information, so we'll use `survey::svyglm()`, rather than the base R function `glm` that might be more familiar. The output of a call to `svyglm()` is not formatted as a publication-ready table. Let's see what happens when we build a model for our **Burkina Faso** sample:

```{r}
covid %>% 
  filter(COUNTRY == "Burkina Faso") %>% 
  as_survey_design(weight = CVQWEIGHT, id = EAID) %>% 
  survey::svyglm(
    formula = HLTHCAREDIFFFEAR ~ AGE + MARSTAT + EDUCATTGEN, 
    family = "quasibinomial"
  ) 
```

<aside>
Because our use of weights results in non-integer outcomes, we'll also need to use the "quasibinomial" modeling distribution, rather than the more typical "binomial" distribution. 
</aside>

The function `gtsummary::tbl_regression()` will tidy this output into a much more reader-friendly format. We'll assign labels to each of our variables using the same `label` argument we saw before, and we'll also choose to exponentiate our regression coefficients so that the results will reflect odds ratios:

```{r}
covid %>% 
  filter(COUNTRY == "Burkina Faso") %>% 
  as_survey_design(weight = CVQWEIGHT, id = EAID) %>% 
  survey::svyglm(
    formula = HLTHCAREDIFFFEAR ~ AGE + MARSTAT + EDUCATTGEN, 
    family = "quasibinomial"
  ) %>% 
  tbl_regression(
    exponentiate = TRUE,
    label = list(
      AGE ~ "Age",
      MARSTAT ~ "Marital status",
      EDUCATTGEN ~ "Education"   
    )
  ) 
```

We can also add conventional "stars" representing the significance of each coefficient with the `add_significance_stars()` function. Here, we could choose to display cluster-robust standard error estimates, but we'll display 95% confidence intervals instead. We'll also customize the header and add a title, using the same `modify` functions shown above.

```{r}
covid %>% 
  filter(COUNTRY == "Burkina Faso") %>% 
  as_survey_design(weight = CVQWEIGHT, id = EAID) %>% 
  survey::svyglm(
    formula = HLTHCAREDIFFFEAR ~ AGE + MARSTAT + EDUCATTGEN, 
    family = "quasibinomial"
  ) %>% 
  tbl_regression(
    exp = TRUE,
    label = list(
      AGE ~ "Age",
      MARSTAT ~ "Marital status",
      EDUCATTGEN ~ "Education"   
    )
  ) %>%
  modify_footnote(everything() ~ NA, abbreviation = TRUE) %>%
  add_significance_stars(hide_se = TRUE, hide_ci = FALSE) %>%
  modify_header(update = list(
    label ~ " " ,
    estimate ~ '**Burkina Faso**',
    ci ~ "95% CI"
  )) %>% 
  modify_spanning_header(
    everything() ~ "## Odds Ratios obtained from Logistic Regression"
  ) 
```

## Results from several models 

Researchers often report results from several models if, for example, they want to compare results including a range of different controls. You might also decide to model data from each of the COVID-19 samples separately in order to highlight important differences between their target populations. How would you merge results from four models into a single table? 

If you repeat the same code shown above for *each* of the four samples, you'll obtain four separate tables. We recommend using `purrr::map()` to store these tables in a list, which you can then pass to `gtsummary::tbl_merge()`. Here, we `map` over each of the factor levels in `COUNTRY`, using `tbl_regression()` to build a regression table for each. We pipe a list of four tables to `tbl_merge()`, and then add a header and title.

```{r, layout = "l-body-outset", eval = F}
levels(covid$COUNTRY) %>% 
  map(~{
    covid %>% 
      as_survey_design(weight = CVQWEIGHT) %>% 
      filter(COUNTRY == .x) %>% 
      survey::svyglm(
        formula = HLTHCAREDIFFFEAR ~ AGE + MARSTAT + EDUCATTGEN, 
        family = "quasibinomial"
      ) %>% 
      tbl_regression(
        exp = TRUE,
        label = list(
          AGE ~ "Age",
          MARSTAT ~ "Marital status",
          EDUCATTGEN ~ "Education"   
        )
      ) %>% 
      italicize_labels() %>% 
      modify_footnote(everything() ~ NA, abbreviation = TRUE) %>%
      add_significance_stars(hide_se = T, hide_ci = F) %>% 
      modify_header(update = list(ci ~ "95% CI"))
  }) %>% 
  tbl_merge() %>% 
  modify_header(update = list(
    label ~ " " ,
    estimate_1 ~ '**Burkina Faso**',

# Output Options 

So now you know that you can make a great-looking table in R that renders nicely in HTML (you're reading this post on a web page, after all). But what if you want to export your table to a Word document, PDF, or some other format? 

For Word documents, try piping your table to the function `gtsummary::as_flex_table()` like this, and then copy / paste the result directly into Word. (You may need to install the package `flextable` first). 

```{r, eval = F}
covid %>% 
  select(AGE, MARSTAT, EDUCATTGEN, URBAN, COUNTRY) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = COUNTRY) %>% 
  as_flex_table()
```

<aside>
**Skip the copy and paste step!** Did you know that you can [create Word documents in R with RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html)?
</aside>

Several printers work well for PDF output, including the very popular `kable_extra`. If you're making a PDF with RMarkdown, for example, you could pipe your table into `gtsummary::as_kable_extra()`. (You may need to install the package `kable_extra` first).

```{r, eval = F}
covid %>% 
  select(AGE, MARSTAT, EDUCATTGEN, URBAN, COUNTRY) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = COUNTRY) %>% 
  as_kable_extra()
```

# Next Steps

We hope you found these steps helpful in using R to create tables for descriptive statistics, survey weights, and model summary output. As always, feel free to reach out to us with any questions. In our next post, we will show how to make likert-style stacked bar charts with R using the PMA COVID-19 survey data. Check back [here](../../index.html#category:COVID-19) in two weeks for the next post in this series!
