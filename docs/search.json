It provides an interactive web dissemination system for PMA data with variable documentation on thousands of harmonized variables on family planning, water and sanitation, and health. PMA is fielded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Johns Hopkins University using streamlined and high-frequency data collection in 11 FP2020 pledging countries. Read more about the project here.\nIPUMS PMA is just one of many IPUMS data projects. IPUMS provides census and survey data from around the world integrated across time and space. IPUMS integration and documentation makes it easy to study change, conduct comparative research, merge information across data types, and analyze individuals within family and community context. Data and services are available free of charge.\nWhy a blog?\nAs the data available at IPUMS PMA continues to grow, we wanted a space to demonstrate the range ways that PMA data can help address some of today’s most pressing women’s health concerns.\nYou’ll find blog posts showing how to use common statistical software to do things like:\ncompare PMA data across countries and survey years\nuse service delivery point data to contextualize outcomes for individuals\nmerge PMA data to external spatial datasets\nexplore data related to water, hygiene, nutrition, and food security\nTry out our code!\nDownload an article and run it in R\nAt the top of every post, you’ll find a button like this one:\n\n\n Download this page as R code\n\n\nClick it, and you’ll receive an R Markdown file containing the full text of the post along with all of the code you’ll need to reproduce it.\n\nYou can run an R Markdown (.Rmd) file in R just like you would run a normal R script (.R). Click here for more information.\nVisit us on GitHub\nWhile it’s not necessary to visit our GitHub repository to access the code you’ll find on this blog, we hope that visitors will feel encouraged to join a conversation, ask questions, or even post code of their own! You can also use the GitHub repository to download code from all of our posts in one step.\nTo submit a post of your own, please take a look at our Contributing Guide and Code of Conduct. By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by the terms of each.\nIf you spot an error or a place where our code could be improved, please consider opening an “issue” on our GitHub repository.\nStatisitcal Software\nCurrently, most of the code highlighted in our articles is written in R, a free and open-source program used by data analysts around the world. We’ve built the blog, itself, with an R package called distill.\n\nNew to R? Not to worry! We’ll post tips and links to help you get going in the “R tips” menu above.\nExperienced R users will notice that we use tidyverse conventions wherever possible, making the tidyverse package library an important prerequisite if you want to try our code on your own. We recommend the excellent, free introductory text R for Data Science for newcomers to R and tidyverse, alike.\nStata users: we are also planning to develop Stata code for each of our articles, which will be made available by a designated download button and in a “stata” folder on the GitHub repository. However, the inline code you’ll find in our articles is likely to remain in R.\n\n\n\n",

You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\nsuch Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\nYou may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n3.3.

You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n5. Termination\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms.

The entire risk as to the\nquality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\nShould any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You\n(not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\nrepair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an\nessential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is\nauthorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n7. Limitation of Liability\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort\n(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any\nContributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as\npermitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,\nspecial, incidental, or consequential damages of any character\nincluding, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\ngoodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any\nand all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party\nshall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This\nlimitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or\npersonal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the\nextent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some\njurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\nincidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and\nlimitation may not apply to You.\n8. Litigation\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n9. Miscellaneous\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

Modified Versions\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\nThis Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.\nIf it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.\nYou may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\nExhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice\nThis Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.\n\n\n\n",
